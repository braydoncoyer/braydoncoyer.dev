      About <mark>Me</mark>
    </h1>
    <p className="text-base font-thin text-secondary">
      My name is Braydon Coyer. I’m a senior full stack engineer with a passion
      for everything front-end.
    </p>
    <p className="text-base font-thin text-secondary">
      As a visual person, one of the ways I communicate is by creating and
      designing. That’s why I chose web development as a career. While I am a
      full stack engineer, my true passion is front-end development. I love the
      challenge of taking a mockup and translating it into a pixel-perfect
      application. CSS is my obsession, and I always love learning new things
      that can help in my quest to make the web a more user-friendly & stunning
      place.
    </p>
    <p className="text-base font-thin text-secondary">
      My career started at a consulting company that had a primary focus on user
      experience and design, and stressed the importance of getting the frontend
      ‘just right.’ While there, I developed an eye for great designs that think
      of the end-user first.
    </p>
    <p className="text-base font-thin text-secondary">
      Now years later, I’ve helped lead the development of several component
      libraries for various clients, including Southwest Airlines, FedEx and
      health care industry leaders.
    </p>
    <p className="text-base font-thin text-secondary">
      I’m very active on CodePen and love creating little projects to share and
      I am well versed in paired programming and test driven development.
    </p>
    <p className="text-base font-thin text-secondary">
      I’m a firm believer that one never truly stops learning and I’m looking to
      join a solid team and work on a product to help bring about change and
      make a difference.
    </p>
    <p className="text-base font-thin text-secondary">
      To put it simply, I have a passion for doing things like this. I would
      love the opportunity to help make a difference in your project.
