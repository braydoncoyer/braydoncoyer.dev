        My name is Braydon Coyer. I’m a senior full stack engineer with a
        passion for everything front-end.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a visual person, one of the ways I communicate is by creating and
        designing. That’s why I chose web development as a career. While I am a
        full stack engineer, my true passion is front-end development. I love
        the challenge of taking a mockup and translating it into a pixel-perfect
        application. CSS is my obsession, and I always love learning new things
        that can help in my quest to make the web a more user-friendly &
        stunning place.
      </p>
      <p>
        My career started at a consulting company that had a primary focus on
        user experience and design, and stressed the importance of getting the
        frontend ‘just right.’ While there, I developed an eye for great designs
        that think of the end-user first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now years later, I’ve helped lead the development of several component
        libraries for various clients, including Southwest Airlines, FedEx and
        health care industry leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m very active on CodePen and love creating little projects to share
        and I am well versed in paired programming and test driven development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a firm believer that one never truly stops learning and I’m looking
        to join a solid team and work on a product to help bring about change
        and make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        To put it simply, I have a passion for doing things like this. I would
        love the opportunity to help make a difference in your project.
