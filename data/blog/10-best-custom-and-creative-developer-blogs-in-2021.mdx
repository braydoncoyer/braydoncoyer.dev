In this article, I’m going to share the 10 best developer blogs that you should visit to inspire your creativity. This list isn’t in any particular order and was curated not based on the insightful content written by the authors, but rather by the eye candy, custom elements and overall experience as a reader.

Let’s dive in!

### 1: Josh Comeau

Whether an article is painted with custom components used to help visualize a certain CSS tip, or readers are presented with editable code blocks to test their knowledge on the subject, Josh has built a developer blog like no other.

He built his website and blog from scratch, allowing complete control over every aspect of his blog — and it really shows!

### 2: Kent C. Dodds

If you aren’t familiar with Kent and his blog, you sure need to be. The creator of the React Testing Library frequently shares invaluable content related to React and testing your front-end code. His blog is powered with MDX, and while very straightforward, provides a distraction-free reading environment for readers to improve their React skills.

### 3: Una Kravets

Una is a Web Developer Advocate at Google and has crafted a custom blog and injected styles that relate to her personality. Her articles often include custom call-out boxes and enticing layout choices. It’s really cool, super inspiring, and you need to [check it out](https://una.im/archive/)!

### 4: Monica Powell

![Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 12.50.22 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/2f1f2003-c717-014a-0ff0-8172b22b7eda/doc/C7E4A85E-8A57-49FB-AB08-B9269B84D9E2/3BF1D5BF-81FB-43B4-A09F-DBE2A76C40CC_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-09%20at%2012.50.22%20PM.png)

Speaking of personality, Monica’s portfolio and blog has a wonderful style that speaks to the developer she is. From custom call-out boxes to code snippets, Monica has put a ton of work into her blog and it really shows.

### 5: Lee Rob

![Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 12.49.31 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/2f1f2003-c717-014a-0ff0-8172b22b7eda/doc/C7E4A85E-8A57-49FB-AB08-B9269B84D9E2/267A82E0-77B0-4587-9903-C60D1E3CB8B7_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-09%20at%2012.49.31%20PM.png)

One of my favorite things about Lee’s portfolio and blog is the overall clean aesthetic, and the blurred navbar. With light and dark mode support, Lee provides a custom blog built with Next.js and powered with MDX.

### 6: Telmo

![Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 12.49.45 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/2f1f2003-c717-014a-0ff0-8172b22b7eda/doc/C7E4A85E-8A57-49FB-AB08-B9269B84D9E2/8463F035-060A-4EA4-8B46-4DAC231139B4_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-09%20at%2012.49.45%20PM.png)

Although his Twitter feed is filled with nonsensical musings, Telmo has created a beautiful technical blog. His custom code snippets and call-out boxes stand out from other blogs and provide a unique reading experience.

### 7: Kyle Gill

![Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 12.49.59 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/2f1f2003-c717-014a-0ff0-8172b22b7eda/doc/C7E4A85E-8A57-49FB-AB08-B9269B84D9E2/84F06D50-91FE-4AFD-8088-2AA657403E77_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-09%20at%2012.49.59%20PM.png)

It’s always interesting to see how each developer approaches their own slice of the internet. Kyle Gill is a Software Engineer who used to work at Gatsby and has developed a personal and technical blog with great personality. I particularly love the background pattern he’s chosen, along with the centered navbar.

### 8: Sam Larsen-Disney

![Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 12.50.35 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/2f1f2003-c717-014a-0ff0-8172b22b7eda/doc/C7E4A85E-8A57-49FB-AB08-B9269B84D9E2/676536CE-3952-44B8-AFA7-F1CD4CCB6767_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-09%20at%2012.50.35%20PM.png)

This one really stands out, and for good reason. Sam has constructed a beautiful portfolio that no doubt has complex aspects to it behind the scenes. With various themes and custom 3D elements scattered throughout articles and pages, Sam posts insightful technical articles with some great eye candy to boot! I just love those article reaction emojis. Super cool!

### 9: Jhey

![Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 12.50.55 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/2f1f2003-c717-014a-0ff0-8172b22b7eda/doc/C7E4A85E-8A57-49FB-AB08-B9269B84D9E2/B1426050-9BF7-42B7-A0A3-749BDFF12058_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-09%20at%2012.50.55%20PM.png)

CSS-wizard Jhey has brought his whimsical personality to his portfolio and blog, often using CodePen demos to help get his point across. If you’re wanting to improve your CSS skills, Jhey’s blog is the place to be! Oh - and - he’s also hidden several easter eggs throughout the website, so make sure you take the time to go hunting!

### 10: Dan Spratling

![Screen Shot 2021-06-09 at 12.51.07 PM.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/2f1f2003-c717-014a-0ff0-8172b22b7eda/doc/C7E4A85E-8A57-49FB-AB08-B9269B84D9E2/54EA0A8D-7AA2-4912-BB07-A5D161A10913_2/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-09%20at%2012.51.07%20PM.png)

Sometimes it can be hard to narrow down what makes a design so great. Yes, user experience plays a major role in it, but often it’s the small things that make up a brilliant design. The attention to detail that Dan has put into his portfolio and blog is astounding. Utilizing big banners and large fonts when appropriate, Dan captures the reader’s attention and leads them through the article with ease.
