Welcome to the first article in the Uncommon HTML Tags series!
With each article in this series, I will introduce a widely unknown HTML tag, discuss compatibility across browsers and cover some real-world use cases with the element.

My hope is that each article broadens your understanding of HTML and helps you discover new tags.

### The < progress > Tag

The `<progress></progress>` tag will create a progress bar and allow you to visualize the completion of a task. This could be handy for showing the progress completion of a multi-page feedback survey, for example!

Let's take a look at how it's used!

```html
<label for="progress">Article Progress:</label>

<progress id="progress" max="100" value="50">50%</progress>
```

As seen in the example above, there are two attributes you can use on the element.

1. `max` - this attribute, if used, is a floating point number and must have a value greater than `0`.

2. `value` - this optional attribute is used to determine the completion of a task and must be a floating point number between `0` and the number set in the `max` attribute. If the `value` attribute is omitted, the progress bar is set to an indeterminate state.

Here is an example of an indeterminate progress bar:

```html
<label for="progress">Article Progress:</label>

<progress id="progress" max="100"></progress>
```
