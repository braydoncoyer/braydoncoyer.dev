If you've been following along on Twitter, Tailwind was hinting that something big was coming. Today we get the reveal.

**Tailwind 2.0! ** 🥳

The first major release to the utility-first framework brings with it some incredible features, and while you should head to the [newly redesigned tailwind website](https://tailwindcss.com/) to read all of the juicy details, if you want a list of my favorite additions to the framework, keep reading...

### A New Color Palette

Tailwind 2.0 introduces a brand-new color palette packed with 220 colors, including 5 different shades of gray. It's beautiful!

### Dark Mode

That's right. Tailwind now officially supports dark mode. And it looks extremely easy to set up!

**UPDATE:** I've just published an article showing you how to use the new features to get dark mode set up in your own project! Check it out [HERE!](https://blog.braydoncoyer.dev/how-to-implement-dark-mode-with-tailwind-v20)

### Extra Wide 2XL Breakpoint

This is a big one for me because I have a 49" ultra-wide monitor. This new breakpoint is designed for 1536px and larger.

### Extended Spacing

With Tailwind 2.0, the default spacing scale has been extended to include micro values as well as new values for use-cases where larger values are needed!

### Group-Hover & Focus-Within By Default

The `group-hover` and `focus-within` classes are now part of the default functionality out-of-the-box with Tailwind 2.0!
