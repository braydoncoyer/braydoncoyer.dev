Dark mode. This design trend has almost become expected by most users with websites and web applications. Dark mode has been possible to integrate with Tailwind projects, but required some workarounds utilizing CSS variables and the config file got messy and hard to read. With Tailwind v2.0, dark mode is built right into the framework and removes the need to work with those pesky CSS variables!

In this article, I'll show you how to get dark mode working in a React application (**stick to the end - I'll give you a starter template!**). Even though this is done in React, the main ideas apply to all modern JavaScript frameworks.

Let's get started!

### TL;DR

I acknowledge this is a long article, so I'll give you a summary.
Tailwind v2.0 gives us the flexibility to choose how we want to implement dark mode. If we want full control, Tailwind will look for an element in the DOM with the `dark` class attached to it. If the element is found, elements styled with the `dark` variant will be applied.
Here's an example of styling a component with dark mode :

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800">
  <h1 class="text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Dark mode is here!</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">Lorem ipsum...</p>
</div>
```

It's up to us to supply the functionality that dynamically adds/removes the `dark` class to a top-level document element. In this tutorial, we utilized the Context API to expose a theme variable and a function to change the value. When the value is changed, it triggers a function in a component called `ThemeProvider` that adds/removes the `dark` class on the root document element.

### Thinking Through the Problem

Still here? Cool!

I prefer to break features down into manageable tasks before I begin to work on them. It helps me understand requirements, identify and pain points and better think through the problem.

The first thing we should figure out is how Tailwind wants developers to work with the new dark mode feature.

According to the documentation, Tailwind v2.0 now includes a `dark` variant. This means that you can style your elements as you normally would, and for those elements that you want to alter their appearance in dark mode, you simply add the 'dark' variant in front of the style utilities. You can chain them too, which is pretty neat. Here's a basic example of styling an element with both light and dark mode:

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800">
  <h1 class="text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Dark mode is here!</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">Lorem ipsum...</p>
</div>
```

Styling elements with the `dark` variant won't actually do anything until dark mode is enabled in the project.

In the `tailwind.config.js` file, we can include the `darkMode` option to enable the feature in Tailwind.

It's important to note that there are two values we can use here - `media` and `class`.

The `media` value uses the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature to detect if the user has dark mode selected as their appearance preference. This is the easiest option and doesn't require any additional set up to get working. Simply set the value to `media`, styles your elements with the `dark` variant, and you're good to go!

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "media",
  // ...
};
```

On the other hand, if we want to include a manual appearance switch on the web application, we can use the `class` value. Since most websites and applications allow us to switch dark mode on or off (usually with a toggle), this is that value we'll use in our example (and we'll manually use `prefers-color-scheme` just for the fun of it!). Because this option doesn't do any of the heavy-lifting for us, it's our job to implement the toggle functionality.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
  // ...
};
```

Continuing the thought above, in order for the dark mode styles to take effect, Tailwind searches through the DOM for an element with a `dark` class applied to it. If it finds that element, all of the `dark` variant style utilities will be applied.

Now that we understand how Tailwind wants us to work with dark mode and what we need to do to manually switch the theme, let's generate the project!

### Generating the React Project & Installing Tailwind

First things first. We need a project to work in. I won't go into detail on how to generate a React project and how to install Tailwind, instead, [I'll link you to the official Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app).

### Enabling Dark Mode

We've hit on this briefly above, but the next step is to actually enable dark mode in our `tailwind.config.js` file. Make sure you set `darkMode` to a value of `class`.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: "class",
  // ...
};
```

### Removing Boilerplate Code

Open the `App.js` file and replace with boilerplate code with the following markup.

```jsx
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="px-4 mx-auto max-w-screen-sm md:max-w-screen-md md:p-0 lg:max-w-screen-lg xl:max-w-screen-xl">
      <div className="min-h-screen flex justify-center items-center">
        <h1 className="text-gray-900 dark:text-white text-3xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl leading-none font-extrabold tracking-tight mb-8">
          Dark Mode Template
        </h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We set some max-width breakpoints on the outer `div` and incorporate the `dark` variant on the `h1` tag so the text color changes to white when dark mode is active.

### The ThemeContext Component

We want any part of our application (page, component, etc) to be able to determine the active theme (light or dark). We can use the Context API to achieve this, so let's create a component that encapsulates that logic and exposes the necessary context.

This component will also store the current theme in local storage so the theme is saved for the next time the user visits the app.

Create a new file (I've placed it in a folder named `components`) called `themeContext.js` and paste the following code.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const getInitialTheme = () => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined" && window.localStorage) {
    const storedPrefs = window.localStorage.getItem("color-theme");
    if (typeof storedPrefs === "string") {
      return storedPrefs;
    }

    const userMedia = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");
    if (userMedia.matches) {
      return "dark";
    }
  }

  // If you want to use dark theme as the default, return 'dark' instead
  return "light";
};

export const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

export const ThemeProvider = ({ initialTheme, children }) => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState(getInitialTheme);

  const rawSetTheme = (rawTheme) => {
    const root = window.document.documentElement;
    const isDark = rawTheme === "dark";

    root.classList.remove(isDark ? "light" : "dark");
    root.classList.add(rawTheme);

    localStorage.setItem("color-theme", rawTheme);
  };

  if (initialTheme) {
    rawSetTheme(initialTheme);
  }

  React.useEffect(() => {
    rawSetTheme(theme);
  }, [theme]);

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

There's a lot here. Let's break it down.

First, we declare and export a variable which holds some state context. We'll import this variable in the `Toggle` component in a few minutes.

```jsx
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
```

The `getInitialTheme()` function looks more complicated than it actually is. This function's job is to check the user's appearance preference, and if they have set it to dark mode, the function returns `dark` as the value. If the user has not selected `dark` as their default system appearance, this function returns `light`. Note that if you want your application to show a dark appearance by default, you can alter this function to return `dark`.

This function is being called inside the `ThemeProvider` component itself when we create a slice of state to hold the value of the theme.

```jsx
export const ThemeProvider = ({ initialTheme, children }) => {
    const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState(getInitialTheme);
...
}
```

Next, we create a function called `rawSetTheme` which takes in a theme value as a parameter.

This function grabs the element that is the root element of the document in our React application. It stores this element in a variable named `root`.

```jsx
const root = window.document.documentElement;
```

Next, we create a boolean variable named `isDark`. This variable needs to determine if the theme that was passed to this function was set to `dark`. Writing an `if` statement here is overkill, so instead we can do it all on one line.

```jsx
const isDark = rawTheme === "dark";
```

Now that we have these pieces, we can dynamically remove the old theme class value on the root element, and then replace it with the new theme value! This is important! Remember, Tailwind looks for an element in the DOM that has a `dark` class applied to it. If that element is found, all of the `dark` variant styles will be applied. We've just completed this functionality with a few lines of code. Cool, huh?

```jsx
root.classList.remove(isDark ? "light" : "dark");
root.classList.add(rawTheme);
```

Finally, we store the user's theme value in local storage so that it is saved for the next time the user visits the web app (the `getInitialTheme()` function above looks for this value and returns the appropriate value).

```jsx
localStorage.setItem("color-theme", rawTheme);
```

Next up, outside of the `rawSetTheme()` function, we create an `if` statement which checks to see if an initial theme value was passed to the component. If so, we send this value straight to the `rawSetTheme()` function and it takes care of the rest.

```jsx
if (initialTheme) {
  rawSetTheme(initialTheme);
}
```

What comes next is super cool. We incorporate a `useEffect` hook in the component which calls the `rawSetTheme()` function whenever the `theme` variable is changed. The real power of this comes into play later when other components want to change the value of the theme.

```jsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  rawSetTheme(theme);
}, [theme]);
```

Finally, we have the mandatory `return` statement which renders the elements passed as children to this component and wraps them in `ThemeContext.Provider` so all of the children have access to `theme` and `setTheme`.

```jsx
return (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>
    {children}
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
);
```

Again, now that other components have access to the `theme` variable and when they change the value, the `rawSetTheme()` function inside of this component gets triggered. Are you starting to see the power of this? Good!

### Creating the Toggle

Next, create a new file called `themeToggle.js` and set up the basic component structure.

```jsx
import React from "react";

const Toggle = () => {
  return <div>...</div>;
};

export default Toggle;
```

Because we've exposed some state with the Context API, we can access the state in this component.

First, import `ThemeContext` (which is what we exported in the previous file), pass it to the `useContext` hook and grab `theme` and `setTheme` from the context.

```jsx
import { ThemeContext } from './themeContext';

const Toggle = () => {
    const { theme, setTheme } = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
...
}
```

Now we can render icons dynamically depending on the theme value. When an icon is clicked, call the `setTheme()` function and pass the appropriate value.

<Infoquote>
  I've installed{" "}
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons" target="_blank">
    react-icons{" "}
  </a>
  and am using the sun and moon icons from Hero Icons
</Infoquote>

Here is the full `Toggle` component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { HiMoon, HiSun } from "react-icons/hi";
import { ThemeContext } from "./themeContext";

const Toggle = () => {
  const { theme, setTheme } = React.useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div className="transition duration-500 ease-in-out rounded-full p-2">
      {theme === "dark" ? (
        <HiSun
          onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark")}
          className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-2xl cursor-pointer"
        />
      ) : (
        <HiMoon
          onClick={() => setTheme(theme === "dark" ? "light" : "dark")}
          className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-2xl cursor-pointer"
        />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Toggle;
```

### Putting it all Together

Now that we have the `themeProvider` and `Toggle` components, let's use them in the `index.js` file.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <main>
        <div className="absolute right-0 top-0 mr-4 mt-4 md:mr-6 md:mt-6">
          <Toggle />
        </div>
        <App />
      </main>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

We want the toggle component to be positioned in the top-right corner of the browser, so we use some absolute position Tailwind utilities to get this working.

The text color should change at this point, but what's the point if the background doesn't change? Let's go ahead and generate a new component that controls the color of the background.

Generate a new file called `background.js` and paste the following code:

```jsx
const Background = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    // Remove transition-all to disable the background color transition.
    <body className="bg-white dark:bg-black transition-all">{children}</body>
  );
};

export default Background;
```

Head back to the `index.js` file and wrap the `<main>` tag inside the new `Background` component.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Background>
        <main>
          <div className="absolute right-0 top-0 mr-4 mt-4 md:mr-6 md:mt-6">
            <Toggle />
          </div>
          <App />
        </main>
      </Background>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now you can run the app using `npm start` and see the background change from black to white when the toggle is clicked! Nice!

### Conclusion

Tailwind v2.0 gives us the flexibility to choose how we want to implement dark mode. In this example, we utilized the Context API to expose a theme variable and a function to change the value. When the value is changed, it triggers a function in the `ThemeProvider` component that adds a class to the root element. If Tailwind sees a `dark` class in the DOM, the `dark` variant styles are applied to your elements. Super cool!
