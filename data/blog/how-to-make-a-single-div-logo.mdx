I love making CSS art; it's one of the best ways to grow your skills - making dynamic-column layouts can only teach you so much.

In this short article, I want to show you how I made this single div logo just using CSS.
Feel free to create a pen over on CodePen and follow along!

### Getting Started

Before we jump into any code, check out [Mihai Dolganiuc](https://dribbble.com/shots/10844834-New-Logo-Collection-7-logos-mark-design) on Dribbble - the logo we're building is based off one in his collection.

The first thing that I like to do when creating a new pen is define the colors I'll be using, set a nice background color and center my canvas. I'm using SCSS in this example, but you could use CSS variables if you'd like.

```css
$background: #ebf5fc;
$light-blue: #00cdfc;
$dark-blue: #007fe8;

body {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  background: $background;
}
```

This gives us a nice off-white color and ensures that any markup we add (coming up next) will be centered on the screen.

Alright! Let's add our single div to the HTML. I'll apply a class name of `logo` so we can target that in our CSS.

```css
<div class="logo"></div>
```

### Thinking Through the Problem

Now comes the fun part. The only way I can think of easily achieving this effect is by using a Pseudo-Element. A Pseudo-Element allow you to style specific parts of an element. While there are many Pseudo-Element selectors, the `::before` selector will allow us to add content before an element. In our case, we can utilize the `::before` selector to layer the rounded-square on top of the blue circle.

### Putting It All Together

Now that we have a solution, let's start to put everything together. Let's start with the blue circle.

```css
.logo {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  // 1
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom left, $dark-blue 15%, $light-blue);
  // 2
  position: relative;
}
```

There are a few important things here that I want to point out.

1. We use a linear-gradient to fill the circle. This gives us a nice fade between the darker blue and the lighter blue. The 15% will start the darker-blue further into the gradient, giving it a more dominant appearance.

2. Because we're going to use a Pseudo-Element for the rounded-square, we need to ensure that we can position that element based off of the position of the circle. That's why we use `position: relative` here.

The CSS above gives us the follow result:

![Screen Shot 2020-10-23 at 8.38.11 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1603460299247/jWMaaLKhi.png)

Now that the easy part is out of the way, let's start to work on the rounded-square.

First, target the `::before` selector. Because I'm using SCSS, I can nest this selector inside my class selector.

```css
.logo {
  ... &::before {
  }
}
```

The `::before` selector won't do anything as-is; we need to set the content, position, background and size of the element first.

```css
&::before {
  // 1
  content: "";
  // 2
  position: absolute;
  // 3
  bottom: 60px;
  left: 60px;
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  background: #ea2f98;
}
```

1. Because we're using the `::before` selector, we need to include the `content` property. This property is used to add content to the element, and in our case, we just set it equal to an empty string. If the `content` property is excluded from this rule, the element won't show up at all.

2. Because we set the circle's `position` to `relative` we can now position this rounded-square based off of the circle by setting `position: absolute` here.

3. We move this element 60px from the bottom and 60px from the left of the blue circle.

It's starting to get there - very nice! Let's get those rounded corners in there and get that stroke effect by using a border.

```css
&::before {
    ...
    border-radius: 60px;
    border: 12px solid $background;
  }

```

At this point, we've pretty much achieved the desired effect. The last major step is to apply the gradient.

Revisit the `background` property and use a linear-gradient instead of the pink color.
In order for the blue circle to show through the rounded-square, we need to have the bottom-left of the square be slightly translucent. We achieve this by using `rgba()` and setting the alpha to `0.8`.

```css
&::before {
    ...
    background: linear-gradient(
      to bottom left,
      rgba(249, 180, 70, 1) 15%,
      rgba(234, 47, 152, 0.8)
    );
    ...
  }

```

Because we're using a Pseudo-Element and are offsetting it from the circle, the entire logo is now off-center. To fix this, we can simply go back to the `.logo` rule and add some margin.

```css
.logo {
  margin: 100px 100px 0 0;
  ...;
}
```

### Conclusion

There we go - we've created a single div logo with the assistance of a Pseduo-Element and some gradients! It really wasn't that difficult was it?

Here's the final result:
