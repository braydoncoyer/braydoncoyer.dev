When Apple announced the iPad Pro years back, I always thought it would be cool to be able to use the 12.9" model and use that as my on-the-go device for coding.

Unfortunately, there weren't any IDEs available on the App Store, and not being able to preview/run the code was a deal-breaker.

When Apple broke away from iOS on the iPad and introduced iPadOS, Safari got a revamp and was classified as a 'desktop-class browsing' experience. And it's gotten even better in the last year.

I'm a big CodePen advocate and [use it a lot for my leisure-coding to create snippets or CSS art](https://codepen.io/braydoncoyer).

This got me thinking. Now that Safari functions more like Safari on a Mac, could I use my iPad to write HTML, CSS & JavaScript using CodePen?

Yep! And it's pretty seamless and even a better experience if you have the iPad Pro Magic Keyboard!

Simply navigate to https://codepen.io/ and create a new pen!

### Different Views & Orientations

CodePen allows you to view the code and preview windows in different orientations.
Personally, I prefer having my editor windows lined up on the top, and my large preview window on the bottom.

Because the iPad Pro has limited screen real-estate, figure out which orientation fits your workflow by clicking on the 'Change View' button in the top-right of the screen.

### Conclusion

If you have an iPad Pro and want to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript, utilizing CodePen in Safari may be a solution!

While it's not a native IDE designed specifically for the iPad, this isn't a bad workaround until an IDE becomes available on the App Store.
