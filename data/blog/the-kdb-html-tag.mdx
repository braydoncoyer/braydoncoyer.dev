Welcome to part two of the Uncommon HTML Tag series!

With each article in this series, I will introduce a widely unknown HTML tag, discuss compatibility across browsers and cover some real-world use cases with the element.

### The < kbd > Tag

The `<kbd></kbd>` tag defines user input on your document and, by default, uses the browser's monospace font for visual distinction.

While the most common use-case for using this tag is to denote keyboard input, it can also be used for input such as voice or other commands.

Let's take a look at how it's used!

```html
<p>To open a new tab on Mac, press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>.</p>

<p>To open a new tab on Windows, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>.</p>
```

Both the opening and closing tags are mandatory and, unlike some of the other HTML tags we've discussed, does not contain any unique attributes (global attributes can be used).

If you want to have the content of the tag stand out a little more, consider applying some custom CSS.
